Hi, welcole to Yam's & Co.
this is a project created using html css and js.

grab elements by using their class name 
create alerts
iterate over items
create events
use a for loop
use a foreach loop...
This is a website for a computer store. anybody who is looking to order a computer online can use our web site to see All caracteristics and add theselected idem to his cart.
This is an unfinished project. the next feature we are implementing is to give to the users the Ability to create an account and proceed to Checkout online.
